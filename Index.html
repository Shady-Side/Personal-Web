    <p>
        Fencing: I enjoy epee and foil. Fencing is super fun and probably the safest sport, even with the diffrent blades.
        There is equiptment such as the lame, your sword and cords that are used to keep points. In epee, you can hit anywhere of your openents body, where as in foil you must hit their torso to get a point.

            Star Gazing is another thing I enjoy. You can see many stars, planets and shooting stars. Constelations are also things that are fun. Another reason why I like star gazing is becuase it is at night and quiet. Me and my freinds often go outside at night to star gaze.
